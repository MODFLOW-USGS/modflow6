\section{Introduction}
This document describes MODFLOW 6 Version \modflowversion.  This distribution is packaged for personal computers using the Microsoft Windows 7 and 10 operating systems, although it may run on other versions of Windows.  The executable file was compiled for 64-bit Windows operating systems and should run on most personal computers.

Version numbers for MODFLOW 6 will follow a major.minor.revision format.  The major number will be increased when there are substantial new changes that may break backward compatibility.  The minor number will be increased when important, but relatively minor new functionality is added.  The revision number will be added when errors are corrected in either the program or input files.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{History}
This section describes changes introduced into MODFLOW 6 for the current release.  Changes introduced in previous releases are in Appendix~A. These changes may substantially affect users.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Version mf6.1.1--Release Candidate

	\underline{NEW FUNCTIONALITY}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Added silent command line switch (\texttt{-s} or \texttt{--silent}) that sends all output to the screen (\texttt{STDOUT})  to a file (``mfsim.stdout'').
		\item Added screen output command line switch (\texttt{-l <str>} or \texttt{--silent <str>}) that controls output to the screen (\texttt{STDOUT}). If \texttt{<str>}  is \texttt{summary}, stress period and time step data are not written to \texttt{STDOUT}. If \texttt{<str>} is \texttt{debug}, normal and debug output are written to \texttt{STDOUT}. 
		\item Added a new option, called SAVE\_SATURATION to the Node Property Flow Package.  When invoked, cell saturation is written to the binary budget file.  The cell saturation can be used by post-processors to determine how much of the cell is saturated without having to know the value for ICELLTYPE or the value for head. If a cell is marked as confined (ICELLTYPE=0) then saturation is always one. If ICELLTYPE is one, then saturation ranges between zero and one.
	\end{itemize}

	\underline{BASIC FUNCTIONALITY}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Corrected an error in how the discretization package (for regular MODFLOW grids) calculates the distance between two cells when one or both of the cells are unconfined.  The error in the code would have only affected XT3D simulations with a regular grid, unconfined conditions, and specification of ANGLE2 in the NPF Package.  
		\item Corrected an error in the use of the AUXMULTNAME option for boundary packages when time series are used.
	\end{itemize}

	\underline{STRESS PACKAGES}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fixed a bug in binary budget file header for CSUB Package budget data written using IMETH=6 (CSUB-ELASTIC and CSUB-INELASTIC) .
		\item Added information on the CSUB Package budget terms and compaction data written the the Input/Output document in the `Description of Groundwater Flow (GWF) Model Binary Output Files' section.
		\item Refactored the SFR Package to remove use of RectangularChGeometry objects and added required functionality as private methods in the SFR module.
		\item Prior to this release, the calculated flows between a standard stress package (WEL, DRN, RIV, GHB, RCH, and EVT) and the connected model cell were based on the RHS and HCOF terms from the previous iteration.  This was not consistent with previous MODFLOW versions.  These packages were modified so that the flows are recalculated using the final converged head solution.  As a result of this change, simulated groundwater flows for these packages may be slightly different (compared to previous releases) if the package HCOF and RHS values depend on the simulated groundwater head.
		\item Added option for saving package convergence for the CSUB Package to a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Package convergence is enabled by specifying PACKAGE\_CONVERGENCE FILEOUT $<$package\_convergence\_filename$>$ in the options block for the package.
	\end{itemize}

	\underline{ADVANCED STRESS PACKAGES}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The code for saving the budget terms for the advanced packages was refactored to use common routines.  These changes should have no affect on simulation results.
		\item The LAK Package would accept negative user-input values for  RAINFALL, EVAPORATION, RUNOFF, INFLOW, and WITHDRAWAL even though the user guide mentioned that negative values are not allowed for these flow terms.  Error checks were added to ensure these values are specified as positive.
		\item Added a storage term to the SFR Package binary output file.  This term is always zero with the present implementation.  An auxiliary variable, called VOLUME, is also written with the storage budget term.  This term contains the calculated water volume in the reach.
		\item  Added additional error trapping in the MAW Package to catch divide by zero errors when calculating the saturated conductance for wells using the SKIN CONDEQN in connections where the cell  transmissivity (the product of geometric mean of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and cell thickness) and well transmissivity (the product of HK\_SKIN and screen thickness) is equal to one. Also add error trapping for well connections using the 1) SKIN CONDEQN where the contrast between the cell and well transmissivities are less than one and 2) SKIN and MEAN CONDEQN where the calculated connection saturated conductance is less than zero.
		\item For the Lake Package, the outlet number was written as ID1 and ID2 for the TO-MVR record in the binary budget file.  This has been changed so that the lake number of the connected outlet is written to ID1 and ID2.  This change was implemented so that lake budgets can be calculated using the information in the lake budget file.
		\item The Lake, Streamflow Routing, and Multi-Aquifer Well Packages were modified to save the user-specified stage or head to the binary output file for lakes, reaches, or wells that are specified as being CONSTANT.  Prior to this change, a no-flow value was written to the package binary output files for constant stage lakes and streams and constant head multi-aquifer wells.  The no-flow value is still written for those lakes, streams, or wells that are specified by the user as being inactive.  This change should make it easier to post-process the results from these packages.
		\item Added option for saving package convergence for the LAK, SFR, and UZF Packages to comma-separated values (CSV) files. Package convergence for the LAK, SFR, and UZF Packages is enabled by specifying PACKAGE\_CONVERGENCE FILEOUT $<$package\_convergence\_filename$>$ in the options block for the package.
	\end{itemize}

	\underline{SOLUTION}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Add OUTER\_DVCLOSE and INNER\_DVCLOSE variables to replace OUTER\_HCLOSE and INNER\_HCLOSE variables. Warning messages will be issued if OUTER\_HCLOSE and/or INNER\_HCLOSE variables are specified. OUTER\_HCLOSE and INNER\_HCLOSE variables will eventually be deprecated. 
		\item Fixed bug in the linear solver when using the STRICT RCLOSE\_OPTION that prevented termination of inner iterations when the INNER\_DVCLOSE and INNER\_RCLOSE criteria were met but the inner iteration count was greater than one. The inner iterations are now terminated when the INNER\_DVCLOSE and INNER\_RCLOSE criteria are met but the linear solver is considered non-converged if the inner iteration count is greater than one.
		\item Eliminated the CSV\_OUTPUT output option in the OPTIONS BLOCK because the output to the comma-separated values (CSV) file was based on the PRINT\_OPTION option. An error condition will occur if CSV\_OUTPUT is specified.
		\item Add CSV\_OUTER\_OUTPUT output option to save outer iteration information to a comma-separated values (CSV) file. The maximum of the model or package dependent-variable change for the outer iteration is written to the CSV file at the end of each outer iteration. 
		\item Add CSV\_INNER\_OUTPUT output option to save inner iteration information to a comma-separated values (CSV) file. The CSV output also the includes maximum dependent-variable change and maximum residual convergence information for the solution and each model (if the solution includes more than one model) and linear acceleration information for each inner iteration. The inner iteration CSV output is written to the CSV file at the end of each outer iteration.
		\item Modified the outer iteration information written to the simulation listing file when PRINT\_OPTION is not NONE to improve the ability of users to evaluate model convergence. Added Package convergence data, eliminated dependent variable changes adjusted by under-relaxation, and flags to indicate when an outer iterations step is considered converged. Information is also provided if PTC causes non-convergence for a outer iteration (even if the model is converged) and if NEWTON UNDER\_RELAXATION resets outer iteration convergence from FALSE to TRUE. Dependent-variable changes for the under-relaxation step in an outer iteration are no longer reported because under-relaxation is only applied if the model or package outer iteration steps do not converge and by definition reduce dependent-variable changes and are not used to evaluate outer iteration convergence.
		\item Eliminated the OUTER\_RCLOSEBND optional variable in the NONLINEAR BLOCK because OUTER\_DVCLOSE is used for all terms used to evaluate package convergence. An error condition will occur if OUTER\_RCLOSEBND is specified.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Known Issues}
This section describes known issues with this release of MODFLOW 6.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
The capability to use Unsaturated Zone Flow (UZF) routing beneath lakes and streams has not been implemented.

\end{enumerate}


% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Distribution File}
The following distribution file is for use on personal computers: \modflowversion.zip.  The distribution file is a compressed zip file. The following directory structure is incorporated in the zip file:

% folder structured created by python script
\input{folder_struct.tex}

It is recommended that no user files are kept in the \modflowversion~directory structure.  If you do plan to put your own files in the \modflowversion~directory structure, do so only by creating additional subdirectories.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Installation and Execution}
There is no installation of MODFLOW 6 other than the requirement that \modflowversion.zip must be unzipped into a location where it can be accessed.  

To make the executable versions of MODFLOW 6 accessible from any directory, the directory containing the executables should be included in the PATH environment variable.  Also, if a prior release of MODFLOW 6 is installed on your system, the directory containing the executables for the prior release should be removed from the PATH environment variable.

As an alternative, the executable file, mf6.exe, in the \modflowversion{}/bin directory can be copied into a directory already included in the PATH environment variable.

To run MODFLOW 6, simply type \texttt{mf6} in a terminal window.  The current working directory must be set to a location where the model input files are located.  Upon execution, MODFLOW 6 will immediately look for file with the name \texttt{mfsim.nam} in the current working directory, and will terminate with an error if it does not find this file.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Compiling MODFLOW 6}
MODFLOW 6 has been compiled using Intel Visual Fortran and gfortran on the Windows and Mac/OS operating systems.  Because the program uses relatively new Fortran capabilities, newer versions of the compilers may be required for successful compilation.  For example, to use gfortran to compile MODFLOW 6, gfortran version 4.9 or newer must be used.  If you have gfortran installed on your computer, you can tell which version it is by entering ``\verb|gfortran --version|'' at a terminal window.

This distribution contains the Microsoft Visual Studio project files for compiling MODFLOW 6 on Windows using the Intel Fortran Compiler.  The files have been used successfully with Visual Studio 2017 and Intel(R) Visual Fortran Compiler 2019.2.190.

This distribution also comes with a makefile for compiling MODFLOW 6 with gfortran.  The makefile is contained in the \texttt{make} folder.

For those familiar with Python, the pymake package can also be used to compile MODFLOW 6.  Additional information on the Python pymake utility can be found at: \url{https://github.com/modflowpy/pymake}.  

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{System Requirements}
MODFLOW 6 is written in Fortran.  It uses features from the 95, 2003, and 2008 language.  The code has been used on UNIX-based computers and personal computers running various forms of the Microsoft Windows operating system.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Testing}
The examples distributed with MODFLOW 6 can be run by navigating to the examples folder and executing the "run.bat" batch files within each example folder.  Alternatively, there is a runall.bat batch file under the examples folder that will run all of the test problems.
