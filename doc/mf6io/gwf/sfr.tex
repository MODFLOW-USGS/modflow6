Input to the Streamflow Routing (SFR) Package is read from the file that has type ``SFR6'' in the Name File. Any number of SFR Packages can be specified for a single groundwater flow model; however, water cannot be routed between reaches in separate packages except in cases where the MVR Package is used to route water between separate packages. All single valued variables are free format.

Reach connectivity must be explicitly specified for this version of the SFR Package, unlike the abbreviated SFR Package segment connectivity specified in previous versions of MODFLOW. Explicit specification of reach connectivity has been adopted to facilitate better validation of stream network connectivity by the program. Explicit reach connectivity means that a reach must be specified as an upstream connection for all downstream connections to the reach. Downstream connections for a reach are denoted with a negative reach number. Flow in a reach is unidirectional, always flowing from the upstream end to the downstream end of a reach. An example of the reach connectivity for a hypothetical stream network is shown in figure~\ref{fig:sfr-connectivity}.

\subsubsection{Available observation types}
Streamflow Routing Package observations include reach stage and all of the terms that contribute to the continuity equation for each stream reach. Additional SFR Package observations include the sum of inflows from upstream reaches and from mover terms (\texttt{upstream-flow}) and downstream outflow from a reach prior to diversions and the mover package (\texttt{downstream-flow}). The data required for each SFR Package observation type is defined in table~\ref{table:gwf-sfrobstype}. Negative and positive values for \texttt{sfr} observations represent a loss from and gain to the GWF model, respectively. For all other flow terms, negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain from the SFR package, respectively.
