\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{XT3D\_OFF}---deactivate the xt3d method to and use the faster and less accurate approximation

\item \texttt{XT3D\_RHS}---add xt3d terms to right-hand side, when possible.  This option uses less memory, but may require more iterations.

\end{description}
\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{diffc}---molecular diffusion coefficient.

\item \texttt{alh}---longitudinal dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If mechanical dispersion is represented (by specifying any dispersivity values) then this array is required.

\item \texttt{alv}---longitudinal dispersivity in vertical direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ALH.

\item \texttt{ath1}---transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If mechanical dispersion is represented (by specifying any dispersivity values) then this array is required.

\item \texttt{ath2}---transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ATH1.

\item \texttt{atv}---transverse dispersivity when flow is in vertical direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ATH2.
