\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that DCY flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{ZERO\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that zero-order decay will occur.  If not specified the solute decay rate will be of first order.

\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{rc}---is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay for the aqueous phase of the mobile domain.  A negative value indicates solute production.  The dimensions of rc for a first-order reaction is one over time.  The dimensions of rc for a zero-order reaction (if ZERO_ORDER_DECAY keyword option is specified) is mass per length cubed per time.
