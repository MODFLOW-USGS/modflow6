\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{auxiliary}---defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   The number of auxiliary variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  Comments cannot be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary variable names.  Auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_STAGE}---keyword to indicate that the list of stream reach stages will be printed to the listing file for every stress period in which ``HEAD PRINT'' is specified in Output Control.  If there is no Output Control option and PRINT\_STAGE is specified, then stages are printed for the last time step of each stress period.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that the list of stream reach flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control.

\item \texttt{MOVER}---keyword to indicate that this instance of the SFR Package can be used with the Water Mover (MVR) Package.  When the MOVER option is specified, additional memory is allocated within the package to store the available, provided, and received water.

\item \texttt{maximum\_picard\_iterations}---value that defines the maximum number of Streamflow Routing picard iterations allowed when solving for reach stages and flows as part of the GWF formulate step. Picard iterations are used to minimize differences in SFR package results between subsequent GWF picard (non-linear) iterations as a result of non-optimal reach numbering. If reaches are numbered in order, from upstream to downstream, MAXIMUM\_PICARD\_ITERATIONS can be set to 1 to reduce model run time. By default, MAXIMUM\_PICARD\_ITERATIONS is equal to 100.

Negative IC numbers indicate connected reaches are connected to the downstream end of the current reach. Positive IC numbers indicate connected reaches are connected to the upstream end of the current reach. The absolute value of IC must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. IC should not be specified when NCON is zero but must be specified otherwise.

\end{description}
\item \textbf{Block: DIVERSIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{rno}---integer value that defines the reach number associated with the specified DIVERSIONS data on the line. RNO must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES.  Reach diversion information must be specified for every reach with a NDV value greater than 0 or the program will terminate with an error.  The program will also terminate with an error if diversion information for a given reach diversion is specified more than once.

\item \texttt{idv}---integer value that defines the downstream diversion number for the diversion for reach RNO. IDV must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NDV for reach RNO.

\item \texttt{iconr}---integer value that defines the downstream reach that will receive the diverted water. IDV must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Furthermore, reach  ICONR must be a downstream connection for reach RNO.

\item \texttt{cprior}---character string value that defines the the prioritization system for the diversion, such as when insufficient water is available to meet all diversion stipulations, and is used in conjunction with the value of FLOW value specified in the STRESS\_PERIOD\_DATA section. Available diversion options include:  (1) CPRIOR = `FRACTION', then the amount of the diversion is computed as a fraction of the streamflow leaving reach RNO ($Q_{DS}$); in this case, 0.0 $\le$ DIVFLOW $\le$ 1.0.  (2) CPRIOR = `EXCESS', a diversion is made only if $Q_{DS}$ for reach RNO exceeds the value of DIVFLOW. If this occurs, then the quantity of water diverted is the excess flow ($Q_{DS} -$ DIVFLOW) and $Q_{DS}$ from reach RNO is set equal to DIVFLOW. This represents a flood-control type of diversion, as described by Danskin and Hanson (2002). (3) CPRIOR = `THRESHOLD', then if $Q_{DS}$ in reach RNO is less than the specified diversion flow DIVFLOW, no water is diverted from reach RNO. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach RNO is greater than or equal to DIVFLOW, DIVFLOW is diverted and $Q_{DS}$ is set to the remainder ($Q_{DS} -$ DIVFLOW)). This approach assumes that once flow in the stream is sufficiently low, diversions from the stream cease, and is the `priority' algorithm that originally was programmed into the STR1 Package (Prudic, 1989).  (4) CPRIOR = `UPTO' -- if $Q_{DS}$ in reach RNO is greater than or equal to the specified diversion flow DIVFLOW, $Q_{DS}$ is reduced by DIVFLOW. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach RNO is less than DIVFLOW, DIVFLOW is set to $Q_{DS}$ and there will be no flow available for reaches connected to downstream end of reach RNO.

\end{description}
\item \textbf{Block: PERIOD}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{iper}---integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.

The IPER value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the IPER value assigned for the previous PERIOD block.  The information specified in the PERIOD block will continue to apply for all subsequent stress periods, unless the program encounters another PERIOD block.

\item \texttt{sfrsetting}---line of information that is parsed into a keyword and values.  Keyword values that can be used to start the SFRSETTING string include: STATUS, MANNING, STAGE, INFLOW, RAINFALL, EVAPORATION, RUNOFF, DIVERSION, UPSTREAM\_FRACTION, and AUXILIARY.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=blockdefinition]
STATUS <status>
MANNING <@manning@>
STAGE <@stage@>
INFLOW <@inflow@>
RAINFALL <@rainfall@>
EVAPORATION <@evaporation@>
RUNOFF <@runoff@>
DIVERSION <idv> <@divflow@> 
UPSTREAM_FRACTION <upstream_fraction>
CROSS_SECTION TAB6 FILEIN <tab6_filename> 
AUXILIARY <auxname> <@auxval@> 
\end{lstlisting}

\item \texttt{status}---keyword option to define stream reach status.  STATUS can be ACTIVE, INACTIVE, or SIMPLE. The SIMPLE STATUS option simulates streamflow using a user-specified stage for a reach or a stage set to the top of the reach (depth = 0). In cases where the simulated leakage calculated using the specified stage exceeds the sum of inflows to the reach, the stage is set to the top of the reach and leakage is set equal to the sum of inflows. Upstream fractions should be changed using the UPSTREAM\_FRACTION SFRSETTING if the status for one or more reaches is changed to ACTIVE or INACTIVE. For example, if one of two downstream connections for a reach is inactivated, the upstream fraction for the active and inactive downstream reach should be changed to 1.0 and 0.0, respectively, to ensure that the active reach receives all of the downstream outflow from the upstream reach. By default, STATUS is ACTIVE.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{manning}---real or character value that defines the Manning's roughness coefficient for the reach. MANNING must be greater than zero.  If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{stage}---real or character value that defines the stage for the reach. The specified STAGE is only applied if the reach uses the simple routing option. If STAGE is not specified for reaches that use the simple routing option, the specified stage is set to the top of the reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{inflow}---real or character value that defines the volumetric inflow rate for the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, inflow rates are zero for each reach.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{rainfall}---real or character value that defines the  volumetric rate per unit area of water added by precipitation directly on the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, rainfall  rates are zero for each reach.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{evaporation}---real or character value that defines the volumetric rate per unit area of water subtracted by evaporation from the streamflow routing reach. A positive evaporation rate should be provided. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. If the volumetric evaporation rate for a reach exceeds the sources of water to the reach (upstream and specified inflows, rainfall, and runoff but excluding groundwater leakage into the reach) the volumetric evaporation rate is limited to the sources of water to the reach. By default, evaporation rates are zero for each reach.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{runoff}---real or character value that defines the volumetric rate of diffuse overland runoff that enters the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. If the volumetric runoff rate for a reach is negative and exceeds inflows to the reach (upstream and specified inflows, and rainfall but excluding groundwater leakage into the reach) the volumetric runoff rate is limited to inflows to the reach and the volumetric evaporation rate for the reach is set to zero. By default, runoff rates are zero for each reach.}

\item \texttt{idv}---an integer value specifying which diversion of reach RNO that DIVFLOW is being specified for.  Must be less or equal to ndv for the current reach (RNO).

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{divflow}---real or character value that defines the volumetric diversion (DIVFLOW) rate for the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \texttt{upstream\_fraction}---real value that defines the fraction of upstream flow (USTRF) from each upstream reach that is applied as upstream inflow to the reach. The sum of all USTRF values for all reaches connected to the same upstream reach must be equal to one.
