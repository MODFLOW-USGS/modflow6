If the DEWATERED keyword is also specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top.  If these keywords are not specified, then the default condition is to calculate the vertical conductance at the start of the simulation using the initial head and the cell properties.  The vertical conductance remains constant for the entire simulation. |

The format for specifying the ghost nodes is the same as described for the GNC Package of the GWF Model.  This includes specifying OPTIONS, DIMENSIONS, and GNCDATA blocks.  The order of the ghost nodes must follow the same order as the order of the cells in the EXCHANGEDATA block.  For the GNCDATA, noden and all of the nodej values are assumed to be located in model 1, and nodem is assumed to be in model 2. |

The format for specifying the water mover information is the same as described for the Water Mover (MVR) Package of the GWF Model, with two exceptions.  First, in the PACKAGES block, the model name must be included as a separate string before each package.  Second, the appropriate model name must be included before \texttt{pname1} and \texttt{pname2} in the BEGIN PERIOD block.  This allows providers and receivers to be located in both models listed as part of this exchange. |

For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, \texttt{cellidm1} is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, \texttt{cellidm1} is the layer number and cell2d number for the two cells.

For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, \texttt{cellidm2} is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, \texttt{cellidm2} is the layer number and cell2d number for the two cells.

| EXG | GWFGWF | EXCHANGEDATA | AUX | DOUBLE PRECISION (NAUX) | represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each GWFGWF Exchange. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each exchange. The values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | PRINT_OPTION | STRING | is a flag that controls printing of convergence information from the solver.  \texttt{NONE} means print nothing. \texttt{SUMMARY} means print only the total number of iterations and nonlinear residual reduction summaries. \texttt{ALL} means print linear matrix solver convergence information to the solution listing file and model specific linear matrix solver convergence information to each model listing file in addition to \texttt{SUMMARY} information. \texttt{NONE} is default if \texttt{print\_option} is not specified. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | COMPLEXITY | STRING | is an optional keyword that defines default non-linear and linear solver parameters.  \texttt{SIMPLE} - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for nearly linear models. This would be used for models that do not include nonlinear stress packages and models that are either confined or consist of a single unconfined layer that is thick enough to contain the water table within a single layer. \texttt{MODERATE} - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for moderately nonlinear models. This would be used for models that include nonlinear stress packages and models that consist of one or more unconfined layers. The \texttt{MODERATE} option should be used when the \texttt{SIMPLE} option does not result in successful convergence.  \texttt{COMPLEX} - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for highly nonlinear models. This would be used for models that include nonlinear stress packages and models that consist of one or more unconfined layers representing complex geology and surface-water/groundwater interaction. The \texttt{COMPLEX} option should be used when the \texttt{MODERATE} option does not result in successful convergence.  Non-linear and linear solver parameters assigned using a specified complexity can be modified in the \texttt{NONLINEAR} and \texttt{LINEAR} blocks. If the \texttt{complexity} option is not specified, \texttt{NONLINEAR} and \texttt{LINEAR} variables will be assigned the simple complexity values. |

| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | CSVFILE | STRING | name of the ascii comma separated values output file to write solver convergence information. If \texttt{PRINT\_OPTION} is \texttt{NONE} or \texttt{SUMMARY}, comma separated values output includes maximum head change convergence information at the end of each outer iteration for each time step. If \texttt{PRINT\_OPTION} is \texttt{ALL}, comma separated values output includes maximum head change and maximum residual convergence information for the solution and each model (if the solution includes more than one model) and linear acceleration information for each inner iteration. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | OUTER_HCLOSE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the head change criterion for convergence of the outer (nonlinear) iterations, in units of length. When the maximum absolute value of the head change at all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal to \texttt{outer\_hclose}, iteration stops. Commonly, \texttt{outer\_hclose} equals 0.01. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | OUTER_MAXIMUM | INTEGER | integer value defining the maximum number of outer (nonlinear) iterations -- that is, calls to the solution routine. For a linear problem \texttt{outer\_maximum} should be 1. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION | STRING | is an optional keyword that defines the nonlinear under-relaxation schemes used. By default under-relaxation is not used.  \texttt{NONE} - under-relaxation is not used. \texttt{SIMPLE} - Simple under-relaxation scheme with a fixed relaxation factor is used.  \texttt{COOLEY} - Cooley under-relaxation scheme is used.  \texttt{DBD} - delta-bar-delta under-relaxation is used.  Note that the under-relaxation schemes are used in conjunction with problems that use the Newton-Raphson formulation, however, experience has indicated that the Cooley under-relaxation and damping work well also for the Picard scheme with the wet/dry options of MODFLOW 6. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION_THETA | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the reduction factor for the learning rate (under-relaxation term) of the delta-bar-delta algorithm. The value of \texttt{under\_relaxation\_theta} is between zero and one. If the change in the variable (head) is of opposite sign to that of the previous iteration, the under-relaxation term is reduced by a factor of \texttt{under\_relaxation\_theta}. The value usually ranges from 0.3 to 0.9; a value of 0.7 works well for most problems. \texttt{under\_relaxation\_theta} only needs to be specified if \texttt{under\_relaxation} is \texttt{DBD}. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION_KAPPA | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the increment for the learning rate (under-relaxation term) of the delta-bar-delta algorithm. The value of \texttt{under\_relaxation\_kappa} is between zero and one. If the change in the variable (head) is of the same sign to that of the previous iteration, the under-relaxation term is increased by an increment of \texttt{under\_relaxation\_kappa}. The value usually ranges from 0.03 to 0.3; a value of 0.1 works well for most problems. \texttt{under\_relaxation\_kappa} only needs to be specified if \texttt{under\_relaxation} is \texttt{DBD}. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION_GAMMA | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the history or memory term factor of the delta-bar-delta algorithm. \texttt{under\_relaxation\_gamma} is between zero and 1 but cannot be equal to one. When \texttt{under\_relaxation\_gamma} is zero, only the most recent history (previous iteration value) is maintained. As \texttt{under\_relaxation\_gamma} is increased, past history of iteration changes has greater influence on the memory term. The memory term is maintained as an exponential average of past changes. Retaining some past history can overcome granular behavior in the calculated function surface and therefore helps to overcome cyclic patterns of non-convergence. The value usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.3; a value of 0.2 works well for most problems. \texttt{under\_relaxation\_gamma} only needs to be specified if \texttt{under\_relaxation} is not \texttt{NONE}. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION_MOMENTUM | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the fraction of past history changes that is added as a momentum term to the step change for a nonlinear iteration. The value of \texttt{under\_relaxation\_momentum} is between zero and one. A large momentum term should only be used when small learning rates are expected. Small amounts of the momentum term help convergence. The value usually ranges from 0.0001 to 0.1; a value of 0.001 works well for most problems. \texttt{under\_relaxation\_momentum} only needs to be specified if \texttt{under\_relaxation} is \texttt{DBD}. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | BACKTRACKING_NUMBER | INTEGER | integer value defining the maximum number of backtracking iterations allowed for residual reduction computations. If \texttt{backtracking\_number} = 0 then the backtracking iterations are omitted. The value usually ranges from 2 to 20; a value of 10 works well for most problems. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | BACKTRACKING_TOLERANCE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the tolerance for residual change that is allowed for residual reduction computations. \texttt{backtracking\_tolerance} should not be less than one to avoid getting stuck in local minima. A large value serves to check for extreme residual increases, while a low value serves to control step size more severely. The value usually ranges from 1.0 to 10$^6$; a value of 10$^4$ works well for most problems but lower values like 1.1 may be required for harder problems. \texttt{backtracking\_tolerance} only needs to be specified if \texttt{backtracking\_number} is greater than zero. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | BACKTRACKING_REDUCTION_FACTOR | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the reduction in step size used for residual reduction computations. The value of \texttt{backtracking\_reduction\_factor} is between zero and one. The value usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.3; a value of 0.2 works well for most problems. \texttt{backtracking\_reduction\_factor} only needs to be specified if \texttt{backtracking\_number} is greater than zero. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | BACKTRACKING_RESIDUAL_LIMIT | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the limit to which the residual is reduced with backtracking. If the residual is smaller than \texttt{backtracking\_residual\_limit}, then further backtracking is not performed. A value of 100 is suitable for large problems and residual reduction to smaller values may only slow down computations. \texttt{backtracking\_residual\_limit} only needs to be specified if \texttt{backtracking\_number} is greater than zero. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | INNER_MAXIMUM | INTEGER | integer value defining the maximum number of inner (linear) iterations. The number typically depends on the characteristics of the matrix solution scheme being used. For nonlinear problems, \texttt{inner\_maximum} usually ranges from 60 to 600; a value of 100 will be sufficient for most linear problems. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | INNER_HCLOSE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the head change criterion for convergence of the inner (linear) iterations, in units of length. When the maximum absolute value of the head change at all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal to \texttt{inner\_hclose}, the matrix solver assumes convergence. Commonly, \texttt{inner\_hclose} is set an order of magnitude less than the \texttt{outer\_hclose} value specified for the \texttt{NONLINEAR} block. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | INNER_RCLOSE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value that defines the flow residual tolerance for convergence of the IMS linear solver and specific flow residual criteria used. This value represents the maximum allowable residual at any single node.  Value is in units of length cubed per time, and must be consistent with \mf length and time units. Usually a value of $1.0 \times 10^{-1}$ is sufficient for the flow-residual criteria when meters and seconds are the defined \mf length and time. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | RCLOSE_OPTION | STRING | an optional keyword that defines the specific flow residual criterion used.  \texttt{L2NORM\_RCLOSE}--an optional keyword that is used to specify that \texttt{inner\_rclose} represents a L-2 Norm closure criteria instead of a infinity-Norm (absolute convergence criteria). When \texttt{L2NORM\_RCLOSE} is specified, a reasonable initial \texttt{inner\_rclose} value is $\left( 1.0 \times 10^{-1} \times \text{active nodes} \right)$ when meters and seconds are the defined \mf length and time.  \texttt{RELATIVE\_RCLOSE}--an optional keyword that is used to specify that \texttt{inner\_rclose} represents a relative L-2 Norm reduction closure criteria instead of a infinity-Norm (absolute convergence criteria). When \texttt{RELATIVE\_RCLOSE} is specified, a reasonable initial \texttt{inner\_rclose} value is $1.0 \times 10^{-4}$ and convergence is achieved for a given inner (linear) iteration when $\Delta h \le$ \texttt{inner\_hclose} and the current L-2 Norm is $\le$ the product of the \texttt{RELATIVE\_RCLOSE} and the initial L-2 Norm for the current inner (linear) iteration. If \texttt{rclose\_option} is not specified, an absolute residual (infinity-norm) criterion is used. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | LINEAR_ACCELERATION | STRING | a keyword that defines the linear acceleration method used by the default IMS linear solvers.  \texttt{CG} - preconditioned conjugate gradient method.  \texttt{BICGSTAB} - preconditioned bi-conjugate gradient stabilized method. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | RELAXATION_FACTOR | DOUBLE PRECISION | optional real value that defines the relaxation factor used by the incomplete LU factorization preconditioners (MILU(0) and MILUT). \texttt{relaxation\_factor} is unitless and should be greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0. \texttt{relaxation\_factor} values of about 1.0 are commonly used, and experience suggests that convergence can be optimized in some cases with relax values of 0.97. A \texttt{relaxation\_factor} value of 0.0 will result in either ILU(0) or ILUT preconditioning (depending on the value specified for \texttt{preconditioner\_levels} and/or \texttt{preconditioner\_drop\_tolerance}). By default,  \texttt{relaxation\_factor} is zero. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | PRECONDITIONER_LEVELS | INTEGER | optional integer value defining the level of fill for ILU decomposition used in the ILUT and MILUT preconditioners. Higher levels of fill provide more robustness but also require more memory. For optimal performance, it is suggested that a large level of fill be applied (7 or 8) with use of a drop tolerance. Specification of a \texttt{preconditioner\_levels} value greater than zero results in use of the ILUT preconditioner. By default, \texttt{preconditioner\_levels} is zero and the zero-fill incomplete LU factorization preconditioners (ILU(0) and MILU(0)) are used. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | PRECONDITIONER_DROP_TOLERANCE | DOUBLE PRECISION | optional real value that defines the drop tolerance used to drop preconditioner terms based on the magnitude of matrix entries in the ILUT and MILUT preconditioners. A value of $10^{-4}$ works well for most problems. By default, \texttt{preconditioner\_drop\_tolerance} is zero and the zero-fill incomplete LU factorization preconditioners (ILU(0) and MILU(0)) are used. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | NUMBER_ORTHOGONALIZATIONS | INTEGER | optional integer value defining the interval used to explicitly recalculate the residual of the flow equation using the solver coefficient matrix, the latest head estimates, and the right hand side. For problems that benefit from explicit recalculation of the residual, a number between 4 and 10 is appropriate. By default, \texttt{number\_orthogonalizations} is zero. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | SCALING_METHOD | STRING | an optional keyword that defines the matrix scaling approach used. By default, matrix scaling is not applied.  \texttt{NONE} - no matrix scaling applied.  \texttt{DIAGONAL} - symmetric matrix scaling using the POLCG preconditioner scaling method in Hill (1992).  \texttt{L2NORM} - symmetric matrix scaling using the L2 norm. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | REORDERING_METHOD | STRING | an optional keyword that defines the matrix reordering approach used. By default, matrix reordering is not applied.  \texttt{NONE} - original ordering.  \texttt{RCM} - reverse Cuthill McKee ordering.  \texttt{MD} - minimum degree ordering. |

| GWF | NAM | OPTIONS | NEWTON | KEYWORD | keyword that activates the Newton-Raphson formulation for groundwater flow between connected, convertible groundwater cells and stress packages that support calculation of Newton-Raphson terms for groundwater exchanges.

No spaces are allowed in \texttt{Pname}.  \texttt{Pname} character values are read and stored by the program for stress packages only.  These names may be useful for labeling purposes when multiple stress packages of the same type are located within a single GWF Model.  If \texttt{Pname} is specified for a stress package, then \texttt{Pname} will be used in the flow budget table in the listing file; it will also be used for the text entry in the cell-by-cell budget file.  \texttt{Pname} is case insensitive and is stored in all upper case letters. |

If the \texttt{idomain} array is not specified, then all model cells exist within the solution.  If the \texttt{idomain} value for a cell is 0, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Input and output values will be read and written for the cell, but internal to the program, the cell is excluded from the solution.  If the \texttt{idomain} value for a cell is 1, the cell exists in the simulation.  If the \texttt{idomain} value for a cell is -1, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Furthermore, the first existing cell above will be connected to the first existing cell below.  This type of cell is referred to as a ``vertical pass through'' cell. |

| GWF | DISV | OPTIONS | YORIGIN | DOUBLE PRECISION | y-position of the origin used for model grid vertices.  This value should be provided in a real-world coordinate system.  If not specified, then a default value equal to zero is used.  The value for \texttt{yorigin} does not affect the model simulation, but it is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space. |
| GWF | DISV | OPTIONS | ANGROT | DOUBLE PRECISION | counter-clockwise rotation angle (in degrees) of the model grid coordinate system relative to a real-world coordinate system.  If not specified, then a default value of 0.0 is assigned.

| GWF | DISV | DIMENSIONS | NLAY | INTEGER | is the number of layers in the model grid. |
| GWF | DISV | DIMENSIONS | NCPL | INTEGER | is the number of cells per layer.  This is a constant value for the grid and it applies to all layers. |

| GWF | DISV | GRIDDATA | BOTM | DOUBLE PRECISION (NLAY, NCPL) | is the bottom elevation for each cell. |
| GWF | DISV | GRIDDATA | IDOMAIN | INTEGER (NLAY, NCPL) | is an optional array that characterizes the existence status of a cell.  If the \texttt{idomain} array is not specified, then all model cells exist within the solution.  If the \texttt{idomain} value for a cell is 0, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Input and output values will be read and written for the cell, but internal to the program, the cell is excluded from the solution.  If the \texttt{idomain} value for a cell is 1, the cell exists in the simulation.  If the \texttt{idomain} value for a cell is -1, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Furthermore, the first existing cell above will be connected to the first existing cell below.  This type of cell is referred to as a ``vertical pass through'' cell. |

| GWF | DISV | CELL2D | ICVERT | INTEGER (NCVERT) | is an array of integer values containing vertex numbers (in the VERTICES block) used to define the cell.  Vertices must be listed in clockwise order.  Cells that are connected must share vertices. |
| GWF | DISU | OPTIONS | LENGTH_UNITS | STRING | is the length units used for this model.  Values can be ``FEET'', ``METERS'', or ``CENTIMETERS''.  If not specified, the default is ``UNKNOWN''. |
| GWF | DISU | OPTIONS | NOGRB | KEYWORD | keyword to deactivate writing of the binary grid file. |
| GWF | DISU | OPTIONS | XORIGIN | DOUBLE PRECISION | x-position of the origin used for model grid vertices.  This value should be provided in a real-world coordinate system.  A default value of zero is assigned if not specified.  The value for \texttt{xorigin} does not affect the model simulation, but it is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space. |
| GWF | DISU | OPTIONS | YORIGIN | DOUBLE PRECISION | y-position of the origin used for model grid vertices.  This value should be provided in a real-world coordinate system.  If not specified, then a default value equal to zero is used.  The value for \texttt{yorigin} does not affect the model simulation, but it is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space. |
| GWF | DISU | OPTIONS | ANGROT | DOUBLE PRECISION | counter-clockwise rotation angle (in degrees) of the model grid coordinate system relative to a real-world coordinate system.  If not specified, then a default value of 0.0 is assigned.  The value for \texttt{angrot} does not affect the model simulation, but it is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space. |
| GWF | DISU | DIMENSIONS | NODES | INTEGER | is the number of cells in the model grid. |
| GWF | DISU | DIMENSIONS | NJA | INTEGER | is the sum of the number of connections and \texttt{nodes}.  When calculating the total number of connections, the connection between cell $n$ and cell $m$ is considered to be different from the connection between cell $m$ and cell $n$.  Thus, \texttt{nja} is equal to the total number of connections, including $n$ to $m$ and $m$ to $n$, and the total number of cells. |
| GWF | DISU | DIMENSIONS | NVERT | INTEGER | is the total number of (x, y) vertex pairs used to define the plan-view shape of each cell in the model grid.  If \texttt{nvert} is not specified or is specified as zero, then the VERTICES and CELL2D blocks below are not read. |
| GWF | DISU | GRIDDATA | TOP | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the top elevation for each cell in the model grid. |
| GWF | DISU | GRIDDATA | BOT | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the bottom elevation for each cell. |
| GWF | DISU | GRIDDATA | AREA | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the cell surface area (in plan view). |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | IAC | INTEGER (NODES) | is the number of connections (plus 1) for each cell.  The sum of \texttt{iac} must be equal to \texttt{nja}. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | JA | INTEGER (NJA) | is a list of cell number (n) followed by its connecting cell numbers (m) for each of the m cells connected to cell n. The number of values to provide for cell n is \texttt{iac(n)}.  This list is sequentially provided for the first to the last cell. The first value in the list must be cell n itself, and the remaining cells must be listed in an increasing order (sorted from lowest number to highest).  Note that the cell and its connections are only supplied for the GWF cells and their connections to the other GWF cells.  Also note that the JA list input may be chopped up to have every node number and its connectivity list on a separate line for ease in readability of the file. To further ease readability of the file, the node number of the cell whose connectivity is subsequently listed, may be expressed as a negative number the sign of which is subsequently corrected by the code. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | IHC | INTEGER (NJA) | is an index array indicating the direction between node n and all of its m connections.  If $ihc=0$ -- cell $n$ and cell $m$ are connected in the vertical direction.  Cell $n$ overlies cell $m$ if the cell number for $n$ is less than $m$; cell $m$ overlies cell $n$ if the cell number for $m$ is less than $n$.  If $ihc=1$ -- cell $n$ and cell $m$ are connected in the horizontal direction.  If $ihc=2$ -- cell $n$ and cell $m$ are connected in the horizontal direction, and the connection is vertically staggered.  A vertically staggered connection is one in which a cell is horizontally connected to more than one cell in a horizontal connection. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | CL12 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is the array containing connection lengths between the center of cell $n$ and the shared face with each adjacent $m$ cell. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | HWVA | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is a symmetric array of size \texttt{nja}.  For horizontal connections, entries in \texttt{hwva} are the horizontal width perpendicular to flow.  For vertical connections, entries in \texttt{hwva} are the vertical area for flow.  Thus, values in the \texttt{hwva} array contain dimensions of both length and area.  Entries in the \texttt{hwva} array have a one-to-one correspondence with the connections specified in the \texttt{ja} array.  Likewise, there is a one-to-one correspondence between entries in the \texttt{hwva} array and entries in the \texttt{ihc} array, which specifies the connection type (horizontal or vertical).  Entries in the \texttt{hwva} array must be symmetric; the program will terminate with an error if the value for \texttt{hwva} for an $n-m$ connection does not equal the value for \texttt{hwva} for the corresponding $m-n$ connection. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | ANGLDEGX | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is the angle (in degrees) between the horizontal x-axis and the outward normal to the face between a cell and its connecting cells (see figure 8 in the MODFLOW-USG documentation). The angle varies between zero and 360.0.  \texttt{angldegx} is only needed if horizontal anisotropy is specified in the NPF Package.  \texttt{angldegx} does not need to be specified if horizontal anisotropy is not used.  \texttt{angldegx} is of size nja; values specified for vertical connections and for the diagonal position are not used.  Note that \texttt{angldegx} is read in degrees, which is different from MODFLOW-USG, which reads a similar variable (anglex) in radians. |
| GWF | DISU | VERTICES | IV | INTEGER | is the vertex number.  Records in the VERTICES block must be listed in consecutive order from 1 to \texttt{nvert}. |

| GWF | DISU | CELL2D | YC | DOUBLE PRECISION | is the y-coordinate for the cell center. |
| GWF | DISU | CELL2D | NCVERT | INTEGER | is the number of vertices required to define the cell.  There may be a different number of vertices for each cell. |
| GWF | DISU | CELL2D | ICVERT | INTEGER (NCVERT) | is an array of integer values containing vertex numbers (in the VERTICES block) used to define the cell.  Vertices must be listed in clockwise order. |
| GWF | IC | GRIDDATA | STRT | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the initial (starting) head---that is, head at the beginning of the GWF Model simulation.  \texttt{strt} must be specified for all simulations, including steady-state simulations. One value is read for every model cell. For simulations in which the first stress period is steady state, the values used for STRT generally do not affect the simulation (exceptions may occur if cells go dry and (or) rewet). The execution time, however, will be less if STRT includes hydraulic heads that are close to the steady-state solution.  A head value lower than the cell bottom can be provided if a cell should start as dry. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | SAVE_FLOWS | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that cell-by-cell flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' in Output Control. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | ALTERNATIVE_CELL_AVERAGING | STRING | is a text keyword to indicate that an alternative method will be used for calculating the conductance for horizontal cell connections.  The text value for \texttt{alternative\_cell\_averaging} can be ``LOGARITHMIC'', ``AMT-LMK'', or ``AMT-HMK''.  ``AMT-LMK'' signifies that the conductance will be calculated using arithmetic-mean thickness and logarithmic-mean hydraulic conductivity.  ``AMT-HMK'' signifies that the conductance will be calculated using arithmetic-mean thickness and harmonic-mean hydraulic conductivity. If the user does not specify a value for \texttt{alternative\_cell\_averaging}, then the harmonic-mean method will be used.  This option cannot be used if the XT3D option is invoked. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | THICKSTRT | KEYWORD | indicates that cells having a negative \texttt{icelltype} are confined, and their cell thickness for conductance calculations will be computed as STRT-BOT rather than TOP-BOT. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | VARIABLECV | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that the vertical conductance will be calculated using the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell and the thickness and properties of the underlying cell.  If the DEWATERED keyword is also specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top.  If these keywords are not specified, then the default condition is to calculate the vertical conductance at the start of the simulation using the initial head and the cell properties.  The vertical conductance remains constant for the entire simulation. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | DEWATERED | KEYWORD | If the DEWATERED keyword is specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | PERCHED | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that when a cell is overlying a dewatered convertible cell, the head difference used in Darcy's Law is equal to the head in the overlying cell minus the bottom elevation of the overlying cell.  If not specified, then the default is to use the head difference between the two cells. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | REWET | KEYWORD | activates model rewetting.  Rewetting is off by default. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | WETFCT | DOUBLE | is a keyword and factor that is included in the calculation of the head that is initially established at a cell when that cell is converted from dry to wet. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | IWETIT | INTEGER | is a keyword and iteration interval for attempting to wet cells. Wetting is attempted every \texttt{iwetit} iteration. This applies to outer iterations and not inner iterations. If \texttt{iwetit} is specified as zero or less, then the value is changed to 1. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | IHDWET | INTEGER | is a keyword and integer flag that determines which equation is used to define the initial head at cells that become wet.  If \texttt{ihdwet} is 0, $h = BOT + WETFCT (hm - BOT)$. If \texttt{ihdwet} is not 0, $h = BOT + WETFCT (THRESH)$. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | XT3D | KEYWORD | keyword indicating that the XT3D formulation will be used.  If the \texttt{RHS} keyword is also included, then the XT3D additional terms will be added to the right-hand side.  If the \texttt{RHS} keyword is excluded, then the XT3D terms will be put into the coefficient matrix.  Use of XT3D will substantially increase the computational effort, but will result in improved accuracy for anisotropic conductivity fields and for unstructured grids in which the CVFD requirement is violated. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | RHS | KEYWORD | If the \texttt{RHS} keyword is also included, then the XT3D additional terms will be added to the right-hand side.  If the \texttt{RHS} keyword is excluded, then the XT3D terms will be put into the coefficient matrix. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | ICELLTYPE | INTEGER (NODES) | flag for each cell that specifies how saturated thickness is treated.  0 means saturated thickness is held constant;  $>$0 means saturated thickness varies with computed head when head is below the cell top; $<$0 means saturated thickness varies with computed head unless the THICKSTRT option is in effect.  When THICKSTRT is in effect, a negative value of icelltype indicates that saturated thickness will be computed as STRT-BOT and held constant. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | K | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the hydraulic conductivity.  When anisotropy is applied, \texttt{k} corresponds to the $K_{11}$ tensor component.  All included cells ($\texttt{IDOMAIN} > 0$) must have a \texttt{k} value greater than zero. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | K22 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the hydraulic conductivity of second ellipsoid axis; for an unrotated case this is the hydraulic conductivity in the y direction.  If \texttt{k22} is not included in the GRIDDATA block, then $k22$ is equal to $k$.  For a regular grid in which no rotation angles are specified, \texttt{k22} is the hydraulic conductivity along columns in the y direction. For an unstructured grid, the user must assign principal x and y axes and provide the angle for each cell connection relative to the assumed x direction.  All included cells ($\texttt{IDOMAIN} > 0$) must have a \texttt{k22} value greater than zero. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | K33 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the hydraulic conductivity of third ellipsoid axis; for an unrotated case, this is the vertical hydraulic conductivity.  When anisotropy is applied, \texttt{k33} corresponds to the $K_{33}$ tensor component.  All included cells ($\texttt{IDOMAIN} > 0$) must have a \texttt{k33} value greater than zero. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | WETDRY | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is a combination of the wetting threshold and a flag to indicate which neighboring cells can cause a cell to become wet. If \texttt{wetdry} $<$ 0, only a cell below a dry cell can cause the cell to become wet. If \texttt{wetdry} $>$ 0, the cell below a dry cell and horizontally adjacent cells can cause a cell to become wet. If \texttt{wetdry} is 0, the cell cannot be wetted. The absolute value of \texttt{wetdry} is the wetting threshold. When the sum of BOT and the absolute value of \texttt{wetdry} at a dry cell is equaled or exceeded by the head at an adjacent cell, the cell is wetted.  \texttt{wetdry} must be specified if ``REWET'' is specified in the OPTIONS block.  If ``REWET'' is not specified in the options block, then \texttt{wetdry} can be entered, and memory will be allocated for it, even though it is not used. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | ANGLE1 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees.  The angle represents the counter-clockwise rotation of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid within the $x-y$ plane.  A value of zero, which is the default value if \texttt{angle1} is not specified, indicates that $K_{11}$ is aligned with the x-axis of the model grid (the row direction for a regular grid) and $K_{22}$ is aligned with the y-axis of the model grid (the column direction for a regular grid). |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | ANGLE2 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees.  The angle represents the tilt of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid up and out of the $x-y$ plane. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | ANGLE3 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees.  The angle represents the rotation of the hydraulic conductivity tensor around its dominant axis. |
| GWF | STO | OPTIONS | SAVE_FLOWS | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that cell-by-cell flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' in Output Control. |
| GWF | STO | OPTIONS | STORAGECOEFFICIENT | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that the \texttt{ss} array is read as storage coefficient rather than specific storage. |
| GWF | STO | GRIDDATA | ICONVERT | INTEGER (NODES) | is a flag for each cell that specifies whether or not a cell is convertible for the storage calculation.  0 indicates confined storage is used. $>$0 indicates confined storage is used when head is above cell top and unconfined storage is used when head is below cell top.  A mixed formulation is when when a cell converts from confined to unconfined (or vice versa) during a single time step. |
| GWF | STO | GRIDDATA | SS | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is specific storage (or the storage coefficient if STORAGECOEFFICIENT is specified as an option). |
| GWF | STO | GRIDDATA | SY | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is specific yield. |

The \texttt{iper} value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the \texttt{iper} value assigned for the previous block. |
| GWF | STO | PERIOD | STEADY-STATE | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that stress-period \texttt{iper} is steady-state. Steady-state conditions will apply until the \texttt{TRANSIENT} keyword is specified in a subsequent \texttt{BEGIN PERIOD} block. |
| GWF | STO | PERIOD | TRANSIENT | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that stress-period \texttt{iper} is transient. Transient conditions will apply until the \texttt{STEADY-STATE} keyword is specified in a subsequent \texttt{BEGIN PERIOD} block. |

| GWF | HFB | PERIOD | IPER | INTEGER | integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.  \texttt{iper} must be less than \texttt{nper} in the TDIS Package and greater than zero.  The \texttt{iper} value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the \texttt{iper} value assigned for the previous block. |
| GWF | HFB | PERIOD | CELLID1 | INTEGER (NCELLDIM) | identifier for the first cell.  For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, \texttt{cellid1} is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, \texttt{cellid1} is the layer number and cell2d number for the two cells.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then \texttt{cellid1} is the node numbers for the cell.  The barrier is located between cells designated as \texttt{cellid1} and \texttt{cellid2}.  For models that use the DIS and DISV grid types, the layer number for \texttt{cellid1} and \texttt{cellid2} must be the same.  For all grid types, cells must be horizontally adjacent or the program will terminate with an error. |
| GWF | HFB | PERIOD | CELLID2 | INTEGER (NCELLDIM) | identifier for the second cell. See \texttt{cellid1} for description of how to specify. |
| GWF | HFB | PERIOD | HYDCHR | DOUBLE PRECISION | is the hydraulic characteristic of the horizontal-flow barrier. The hydraulic characteristic is the barrier hydraulic conductivity divided by the width of the horizontal-flow barrier. If hydraulic characteristic is negative, then it acts as a multiplier to the conductance between the two model cells specified as containing a barrier. For example, if the value for \texttt{hydchr} was specified as 1.5, the conductance calculated for the two cells would be multiplied by 1.5. |
| GWF | CHD | OPTIONS | AUXILIARY | STRING (NAUX) | defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   The number of auxiliary variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  Comments cannot be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary variable names.  Auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one line in the options block. |
| GWF | CHD | OPTIONS | AUXMULTNAME | STRING | name of auxiliary variable to be used as multiplier of CHD head value. |

The \texttt{iper} value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the \texttt{iper} value assigned for the previous block. |
| GWF | CHD | PERIOD | CELLID | INTEGER (NCELLDIM) | is the cell identifier, and depends on the type of grid that is used for the simulation.  For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, \texttt{cellid} is the layer, row, and column.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, \texttt{cellid} is the layer and cell2d number.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then \texttt{cellid} is the node number for the cell. |
| GWF | CHD | PERIOD | HEAD | DOUBLE PRECISION | is the head at the boundary. |
| GWF | CHD | PERIOD | AUX | DOUBLE PRECISION (NAUX) | represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each constant head. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each constant head. The values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block.  If the package supports time series and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. |
| GWF | CHD | PERIOD | BOUNDNAME | STRING | name of the constant head boundary cell.  \texttt{boundname} is an ASCII character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters.  If \texttt{boundname} contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be enclosed within single quotes. |
| GWF | WEL | OPTIONS | AUXILIARY | STRING (NAUX) | defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   The number of auxiliary variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  Comments cannot be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary variable names.  Auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one line in the options block. |
| GWF | WEL | OPTIONS | AUXMULTNAME | STRING | name of auxiliary variable to be used as multiplier of well flow rate. |

| GWF | WEL | OPTIONS | PRINT_FLOWS | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that the list of well flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control.

Negative pumping rates are adjusted to 0 or a smaller negative value when the head in the cell is equal to or less than the calculated interval above the cell bottom. \texttt{auto\_flow\_reduce} is set to 0.1 if the specified value is less than or equal to zero. By default, negative pumping rates are not reduced during a simulation. |

| GWF | SFR | DIVERSIONS | RNO | INTEGER | integer value that defines the reach number associated with the specified data on the line. \texttt{rno} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to \texttt{MAXBOUND}. |
| GWF | SFR | DIVERSIONS | IDV | INTEGER | integer value that defines the downstream diversion number for the diversion for reach \texttt{rno}. \texttt{idv} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to \texttt{ndv} for reach \texttt{rno}. |

Furthermore, reach  \texttt{iconr} must be a downstream connection for reach \texttt{rno}. |
| GWF | SFR | DIVERSIONS | CPRIOR | STRING | character string value that defines the the prioritization system for the diversion, such as when insufficient water is available to meet all diversion stipulations, and is used in conjunction with the value of \texttt{flow} value specified in the \texttt{STRESS\_PERIOD\_DATA} section. Available diversion options include:  (1) \texttt{cprior} = `FRACTION', then the amount of the diversion is computed as a fraction of the streamflow leaving reach \texttt{rno} ($Q_{DS}$); in this case, 0.0 $\le$ \texttt{divflow} $\le$ 1.0.  (2) \texttt{cprior} = `EXCESS', a diversion is made only if $Q_{DS}$ for reach \texttt{rno} exceeds the value of \texttt{divflow}. If this occurs, then the quantity of water diverted is the excess flow ($Q_{DS} -$ \texttt{divflow}) and $Q_{DS}$ from reach \texttt{rno} is set equal to \texttt{divflow}. This represents a flood-control type of diversion, as described by Danskin and Hanson (2002). (3) \texttt{cprior} = `THRESHOLD', then if $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is less than the specified diversion flow (\texttt{divflow}), no water is diverted from reach \texttt{rno}. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is greater than or equal to (\texttt{divflow}), (\texttt{divflow}) is diverted and $Q_{DS}$ is set to the remainder ($Q_{DS} -$ \texttt{divflow})). This approach assumes that once flow in the stream is sufficiently low, diversions from the stream cease, and is the `priority' algorithm that originally was programmed into the STR1 Package (Prudic, 1989).  (4) \texttt{cprior} = `UPTO' -- if $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is greater than or equal to the specified diversion flow (\texttt{divflow}), $Q_{DS}$ is reduced by \texttt{divflow}. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is less than (\texttt{divflow}), \texttt{divflow} is set to $Q_{DS}$ and there will be no flow available for reaches connected to downstream end of reach \texttt{rno}. |

| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | STATUS | STRING | keyword option to define stream reach status.  \texttt{status} can be \texttt{ACTIVE}, \texttt{INACTIVE}, or \texttt{SIMPLE}. The \texttt{SIMPLE} \texttt{status} option simulates streamflow using a user-specified stage for a reach or a stage set to the top of the reach (depth = 0). In cases where the simulated leakage calculated using the specified stage exceeds the sum of inflows to the reach, the stage is set to the top of the reach and leakage is set equal to the sum of inflows. Upstream factions should be changed using the \texttt{UPSTREAM\_FRACTION} \texttt{sfrsetting} if the status for one or more reaches is changed to \texttt{ACTIVE} or \texttt{INACTIVE}. For example, if one of two downstream connections for a reach is inactivated, the upstream fraction for the active and inactive downstream reach should be changed to 1.0 and 0.0, respectively, to ensure that the active reach receives all of the downstream outflow from the upstream reach. By default, \texttt{status} is \texttt{ACTIVE}. |
