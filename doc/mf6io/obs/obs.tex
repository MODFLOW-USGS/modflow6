For consistency with earlier versions of MODFLOW (specifically, MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005), \programname{} supports an ``Observation'' utility. Unlike the earlier versions of MODFLOW, the Observation utility of \programname{} does not require input of ``observed'' values, which typically were field- or lab-measured values. The Observation utility described here provides options for extracting numeric values of interest generated in the course of a model run. The Observation utility does not calculate residual values (differences between observed and model-calculated values). Output generated by the Observation utility is designed to facilitate further processing. For convenience and for consistency with earlier terminology, individual entries of the Observation utility are referred to as ``observations.''

Input for the Observation utility is read from one or more input files, where each file is associated with a specific model or package. For extracting values simulated by a GWF model, input is read from a file that is specified as type ``OBS6'' in the Name File. For extracting model values associated with a package, input is read from a file designated by the keyword ``OBS6'' in the Options block of the package of interest. The structures of observation input files for models and packages do not differ. Where a file name (or path name) containing spaces is to be read, enclose the name in single quotation marks.

Each OBS6 file can contain an OPTIONS block and one or more CONTINUOUS blocks. Each OBS6 file must contain at least one block. If present, the OPTIONS block must appear first. The CONTINUOUS blocks can be listed in any order. Comments, indicated by the presence of the ``\#'' character in column 1, can appear anywhere in the file and are ignored. 

Observations are output at the end of each time step and represent the value used by \mf during the time step. When input to the OBS utility references a stress-package boundary (for packages other than the advanced stress packages) that is not defined for a stress period of interest, a special NODATA value, indicating that a simulated value is not available, is written to output. The NODATA value is $3.0 \times 10\textsuperscript{30}$. 

Output files to be generated by the Observation utility can be either text or binary. When a text file is used for output, the user can specify the number of digits of precision are to be used in writing values. For compatibility with common spreadsheet programs, text files are written in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format. For this reason, text output files are commonly named with ``csv'' as the extension. By convention, binary output files are named with ``bsv'' (for ``binary simulated values'') as the extension.

%When a binary file is used, the user can specify whether floating-point numbers should be written in single or double precision.

%For CONTINUOUS observations, note that boundaries identified by ID (and ID2 where used) must be defined in the corresponding package input file in all stress periods of the simulation. This requirement may mean that in some PERIOD blocks, the user will need to include entries that have no affect on the model; for example one could include a well with a recharge rate of zero or a drain boundary with a conductance of zero. In some situations preparation of input can be simplified by splitting package input into multiple input files, so that boundaries included in CONTINUOUS observations are separated from other boundaries simulated by the same package type.
