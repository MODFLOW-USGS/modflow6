Source and Sink Mixing (SSM) Package information is read from the file that is specified by ``SSM6'' as the file type.  Only one SSM Package can be specified for a GWT model.  The SSM Package is required if the flow model has any stress packages.

The SSM Package is used to add or remove solute mass from GWT model cells based on inflows and outflows from GWF stress packages.  If a GWF stress package provides flow into a model cell, that flow can be assigned a user-specified concentration.  If a GWT stress package removes water from a model cell, the concentration of that water is typically the concentration of the cell, but a ``MIXED'' option is also included so that the user can specify the concentration of that withdrawn water.  This may be useful for representing evapotranspiration, for example.  There are several different ways for the user to specify the concentrations.  

\begin{itemize}
\item The default condition is that sources have a concentration of zero and sinks withdraw water at the calculated concentration of the cell.  This default condition is assigned to any GWF stress package that is not included in a SOURCES block or FILEINPUT block.
\item A second option is to assign auxiliary variables in the GWF model and include a concentration for each stress boundary.  In this case, the user provides the name of the package and the name of the auxiliary variable containing concentration values for each boundary.  As described below for srctype, there are multiple options for defining this behavior.
\item A third option is to prepare an SPC6 file for any desired GWF stress package.  This SPC6 file allows users to change concentrations by stress period, or to use the time-series option to interpolate concentrations by time step.  This third option was introduced in MODFLOW version 6.3.0.  Information for this approach is entered in an optional FILEINPUT block below.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The auxiliary method and the file input method can both be used for a GWT model, but only one approach can be assigned per GWF stress package.   If a flow package specified in the SOURCES or FILEINPUT blocks is also represented using an advanced transport package (SFT, LKT, MWT, or UZT), then the advanced transport package will override SSM calculations for that package.

\subsection{Stress Package Concentrations (SPC) -- List-Based Input}
An SPC6 file can be prepared to provide user-specified concentrations for a GWF stress package, such a Well or General-Head Boundary Package, for example.  One SPC6 file applies to one GWF stress package.  Names for the SPC6 input files are provided in the FILEINPUT block of the SSM Package.  SPC6 entries cannot be specified in the GWT name file.  Use of the SPC6 input file is an alternative to specifying stress package concentrations as auxiliary variables in the flow model stress package.  

Stress package concentrations can be specified in the SPC6 input file using lists or arrays.  List-based input is used by default, and is described here.  Array-based concentration input can be specified for the Recharge and Evapotranspiration Packages, but only if those packages use the READASARRAYS option.  Instructions for specifying array-based stress package concentrations are described in the next section.

The boundary number in the PERIOD block corresponds to the boundary number in the GWF stress period package.  Assignment of the boundary number is straightforward for the advanced packages (SFR, LAK, MAW, and UZF) because the features in these advanced packages are defined once at the beginning of the simulation and they do not change.  For the other stress packages, however, the order of boundaries may change between stress periods.  Consider the following Well Package input file, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
# This is an example of a GWF Well Package
# in which the order of the wells changes from
# stress period 1 to 2.  This must be explicitly
# handled by the user if using the SPC6 input
# for a GWT model.
BEGIN options
END options

BEGIN dimensions
  MAXBOUND  3
  BOUNDNAMES
END dimensions

BEGIN period  1
  1 77 65   -2200  SHALLOW_WELL
  2 77 65   -24.0  INTERMEDIATE_WELL
  3 77 65   -6.20  DEEP_WELL
END period

BEGIN period  2
  1 77 65   -1100  SHALLOW_WELL
  3 77 65   -3.10  DEEP_WELL
  2 77 65   -12.0  INTERMEDIATE_WELL
END period
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In this Well input file, the order of the wells changed between periods 1 and 2.  This reordering must be explicitly taken into account by the user when creating an SSMI6 file, because the boundary number in the SSMI file corresponds to the boundary number in the Well input file.  In stress period 1, boundary number 2 is the INTERMEDIATE\_WELL, whereas in stress period 2, boundary number 2 is the DEEP\_WELL.  When using this SSMI capability to specify boundary concentrations, it is recommended that users write the corresponding GWF stress packages using the same number, cell locations, and order of boundary conditions for each stress period.   In addition, users can activate the PRINT\_FLOWS option in the SSM input file.  When the SSM Package prints the individual solute flows to the transport list file, it includes a column containing the boundary concentration.  Users can check the boundary concentrations in this output to verify that they are assigned as intended.
