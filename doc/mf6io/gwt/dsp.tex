Dispersion (DSP) Package information is read from the file that is specified by ``DSP6'' as the file type.  Only one DSP Package can be specified for a GWT model.  By default, the DSP Package uses the mathematical formulation presented for the XT3D option of the NPF Package to represent full three-dimensional anisotropy in groundwater flow.  XT3D can be computationally expensive and can be turned off to use a simplified and approximate form of the dispersion equations.  For most problems, however, XT3D will be required to accurately represent dispersion.
