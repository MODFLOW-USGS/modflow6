@article{Johannsen2003,
	Abstract = {The Elder problem is an example of a density driven flow, motivated by experiments of a thermally driven convection in porous media. It is a mathematical benchmark problem used for code verification of density driven flow simulators and comparison of issues related to its numerical treatment. Its bifurcation diagram with respect to the Rayleigh number is investigated on a hierarchy of uniformly refined grids. Eleven stationary solutions are shown to exist for the Elder problem. Similar solutions can be found using the Boussinesq approximation. Despite this similarity the corresponding bifurcation diagrams are shown to be topologically not equivalent. This gives rise to serious doubts on the validity of Boussinesq approximation for this model problem. Grid convergence is investigated for the numerically obtained solutions.},

@article{vanreeuwijk2009,
	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to clarify and circumvent the issue of multiple steady state solutions in the Elder problem. A pseudospectral method is used to avoid numerical error associated with spatial discretization. The pseudospectral method is verified by comparison to an analytical solution at Rayleigh number, Ra = 0, and by reproducing the three stable steady state solutions that are known to exist at Ra = 400. A bifurcation diagram for 0 < Ra < 400, which is free of discretization error, confirms that multiple steady states are indeed an intrinsic characteristic of the Elder problem. The existence of multiple steady states makes the Ra = 400 Elder problem less suitable for benchmarking numerical models. To avoid the multiple steady states, we propose a benchmark at Ra = 60. The results for this Low Rayleigh Number Elder Problem are presented and compared to simulations with the commercial groundwater modeling package FEFLOW. Correspondence between the pseudospectral model and FEFLOW is excellent.},

	Abstract = {Environmental processes frequently exhibit threshold-type behavior, e.g., the initiation of fluxes such as snowmelt, recharge, and quick flow. Incorporating such thresholds into hydrological models introduces discontinuities into the objective functions used in model calibration, making parameter estimation unnecessarily more difficult. Moreover, this study shows that model thresholds can produce spurious multimodality in least squares objective functions even if the underlying model is near linear in its parameters. In contrast, smoothing the model with respect to its parameters and inputs yields differentiable objective functions and, in some cases, can also improve its macroscale characteristics by removing spurious secondary optima. This simplifies model calibration and sensitivity analysis by reducing the complexity of objective functions and permitting the use of powerful derivative-based analysis methods such as Newton-type optimization and Hessian-based uncertainty assessment. This paper details smoothing strategies for several classes of thresholds and discontinuities commonly found in hydrological models, including step and angle discontinuities in the constitutive functions and flux constraints arising from conservation laws in the governing differential equations. The smoothing algorithms and their parameters are selected to ensure infinite differentiability of the model and its objective functions while preserving the macroscale behavior of the original governing equations. The improvements in the structure of the model and its objective functions are illustrated empirically for a degree-day-based snow model. The smoothing techniques are general and can be applied to other models with thresholds.},
