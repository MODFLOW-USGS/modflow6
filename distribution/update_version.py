"""
Update files in this modflow6 repository according to release information.

This script is used to update several files in the modflow6 repository, including:

  ../version.txt
  ../meson.build
  ../doc/version.tex
  ../README.md
  ../DISCLAIMER.md
  ../code.json
  ../src/Utilities/version.f90

Information in these files include version number (major.minor.patch[label]), build
timestamp, whether or not the release is preliminary/provisional or official/approved,
whether the source code should be compiled in develop mode (IDEVELOPMODE = 1) or for
release, and other metadata.

The version number is read from ../version.txt, which contains major, minor, and patch
version numbers, and an optional label. Version numbers are substituted into source
code, latex files, markdown files, etc. The version number can be provided explicitly
using --version, short -v.

If the --releasemode flag is provided, IDEVELOPMODE is set to 0 in
src/Utilities/version.f90.  Otherwise, IDEVELOPMODE is set to 1.

if the --approved flag (short -a) is provided, the disclaimer in
src/Utilities/version.f90 and the README/DISCLAIMER markdown files is modified to
reflect review and approval. Otherwise the language reflects preliminary/provisional
status, and version strings contain "(preliminary)".
