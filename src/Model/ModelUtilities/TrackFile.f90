  !> @brief Output file containing all or some particle pathlines.
  !!
  !! Can be associated with a particle release point (PRP) package
  !! or with an entire model, and can be binary or comma-separated.
  !!
  !! Each particle's pathline consists of 1+ records reported as the particle
  !! is tracked over the model domain. Records are snapshots of the particle's
  !! state (e.g. tracking status, position) at a particular moment in time.
  !!
  !! Particles have no ID property. Particles can be uniquely identified
  !! by composite key, i.e. combination of:
  !!
  !!   - imdl: originating model ID
  !!   - iprp: originating PRP ID
  !!   - irpt: particle release location ID
  !!   - trelease: particle release time
  !!
  !! Each record has an "ireason" property, which identifies the cause of
  !! the record. The user selects 1+ conditions or events for recording.
  !! Identical records (except "ireason") may be duplicated if multiple
  !! reporting conditions apply to particles at the same moment in time.
  !! Each "ireason" value corresponds to an OC "trackevent" option value:
  !!
  !!     0: particle released
  !!     1: particle transitioned between cells
  !!     2: current time step ended****
  !!     3: particle terminated
  !!     4: particle exited weak sink
  !!     5: user-specified tracking time
  !!
  !! Each record has an "istatus" property, which is the tracking status;
  !! e.g., awaiting release, active, terminated. A particle may terminate
  !! for several reasons. Status values greater than one imply termination.
  !! Particle status strictly increases over time, starting at zero:
  !!
  !!     0: pending release*
  !!     1: active
  !!     2: terminated at boundary face
  !!     3: terminated in weak sink cell
  !!     4: terminated in weak source cell**
  !!     5: terminated in cell with no exit face
  !!     6: terminated in cell with specified zone number
  !!     7: terminated in inactive cell
  !!     8: permanently unreleased***
  !!     9: terminated in subcell with no exit face*****
  !!
  !! PRT shares the same status enumeration as MODPATH 7. However, some
  !! don't apply to PRT; for instance, MODPATH 7 distinguishes forwards
  !! and backwards tracking, but status value 4 is not used by PRT.
  !!
  !! Notes
  !! -----
  !!
  !!   * is this necessary?
  !!   ** unnecessary since PRT makes no distinction between forwards/backwards tracking
  !!   *** e.g., released into an inactive cell, a stop zone cell, or a termination zone
  !!   **** this may coincide with termination, in which case two events are reported
  !!   ***** PRT-specific status indicating a particle stopped within a cell subcell
